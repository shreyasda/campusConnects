# campusConnects
“Campus Connects” is a Web Application that functions as an Event Management System which allows users to create, manage, and promote events of various departments and student clubs of NIE.
In this project, we have used the Django framework extensively for the backend, as Django is a multipurpose and heavy-duty Python Backend framework. The front end is created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
When creating a Django project using a virtual environment, the file structure typically follows a standard layout that organizes various components and functionalities of the project.
